Dear potential future team-mate,

congratulations, you were chosen to join the next round in our recruiting process! We challenged you already in an interview and we think that you might be a good fit for the team. But, as we all love technology and coding, we want to challenge you now on exactly that.

This code challenge has no correct answer. It may suffice the requirements, but you should not spend more than 2 hours on the challenge. The result does neither need to be complete nor perfect. We will take your code as a starting point for further discussions in a shared screen session.

__Instructions / Requirements:__

- Build an simple, but functional Flutter/Dart App for Android/iOS.
- The app should list the top 10 Flutter/Dart projects at GitHub (https://docs.github.com/en/rest).
- You can use any IDE of your choice.
- The code shall be put into this repository.
- Commit the different stages of your development.

Once you have finished you can push your code and open a pull request.

If you have any question, please contact the Senorics colleague who invited you to the code challenge. She/he will happily help you out!

Good luck! We are looking forward discussing with you this challenge!

Best regards

Senorics Software Team
